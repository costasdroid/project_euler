The mod inverse of $1504170715041707$ is $3451657199285664$ in modulo $4503599627370517$.

From the 1st number $1504170715041707$ to the 2nd $3008341430083414$ the drop is very high, so for the first up to 1_000_000 we can iterate one by one.

From 1_000_000 to 1 (for sure it is 1 because the numbers ar coprime) we create a list to search for each Eulercoin.
